# User name in title

**Supervisor** can see user full name as a page title and user identifiers as a subtitle to be able to spot it right away.

- move user name to the title
- on all pages: user detail, edit profile, change password, roles, groups, modules
- move birth date, primary and secondary identifier underneath the title (use separators, show identifier name in the tooltip, show only available identifiers)
- remove breadcrumbs on User detail page (not on other sub-pages)
- add full-name to profile card
