# Cache cleanup

Stale responses in forecast proxy cache are removed periodically.

- In #20 disk cache for forecast API HTTP responses was implemented using [make-fetch-happen](https://github.com/zkat/make-fetch-happen) and [cacache](https://github.com/zkat/cacache).
- from the range of options identified, it seems that these two are most reasonable:
  1. Replace cacache by custom **in-memory cache**. It needs either fix of cloning issue in node-fetch or pipe cache to response to avoid it.
  2. Set up **disk cache cleanup**. It is possible to clean it on operating system level (cron) or node runtime level (`cacache.rm.all`) with some node scheduler.
- all options map:
