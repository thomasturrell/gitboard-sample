# Layout reorganization

1. Breadcrumbs are displayed in the top section if present.
2. Logout button is moved to the profile menu.
3. Page titles contain object name instead of the object type.
4. First level and current page title are not present in breadcrumbs.

So that the space on the page is used efficiently and information is not duplicated.

- replace profile navigation by profile menu
- move logout button to the profile menu
- remove top toolbar
- fix breadcrumb spacing to title and to the top of the page
- keep heading on the same position on page regardless breadcrumbs
- fix edit profile page (backend)
